# 11-3D-Game
Happy Thanksgiving! This is a turkey shooting game. There are also evergreen Deer included. An idea that I thought of that is a combination of deer 3-D model and an evergreen material. There is a realistic camoflage pistol grip shotgun, that shoots realistic shotgun shells. A fall scene is where the game takes place. There is a lives and scoring mechanism. The lives will decrease when you fall down a sinkhole. While the score will increase when you hit a turkey or evergreen deer.
